*) BlocListener:
    -> Previously we use BlocListener in response of bloc/cubit state change
    -> Pros:
        -> it take care Internally of all StreamSubscription
        -> No need to take care of stream/memory leaks anymore 
    -> Cons:
        -> The UI may get cluttered & hard to read with multiple BlocListeners

*) Why BlocListener over StreamSubscription?
    -> you don't have to StreamSubscription any more
    -> bloc/cubit manage it's StreamSubscription internally

-> so we will listen to the 'InternetCubit' state change in 'home_screen.dart'
