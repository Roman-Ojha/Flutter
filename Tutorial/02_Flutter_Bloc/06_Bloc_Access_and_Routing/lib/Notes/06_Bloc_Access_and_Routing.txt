*) Bloc Access:
    -> here we will know how we can access bloc instance across various scenario : BlocProvider() vs BlocProvider.value()
    -> previously we had learned about how we can provide single bloc instance to the widget tree of a single page by using 'BlocProvider' there we had provided locally in single screen
    -> what if we want to provide to another screen to multiple screen or even globally

*) Local Access:
    -> it's called local access because the instance will only be available locally inside that screen

*) Route Access:
    -> providing an instance of a bloc/cubit to Multiple Screens is called as Route Access
    -> To understand Route Access we need to understand Flutter Routing
        => Flutter Routing Options:
            -> Anonymous Routing
                -> Routing without a RouteName
                -> Only the screen are used to navigate
                -> Suitable for Small Application
            -> Named Routing
                -> Navigating With a Routing Name
                -> Route Names and there associated Screens are setup insides parameter of MaterialApp widget
                -> Suitable for Small-Medium Application
            -> Generated Routing
                -> Navigating With A Route Name
                -> Route name and their associated Screens are setup up inside a separate onGenerateRoute Function
                -> Suitable for Large Application
    *) Anonymous Routing:
        -> BlocProvider.value() will provide the bloc/cubit instance to multiple Route
        -> BlocProvider.value(
            value:existingBloc,
        )
            -> BlocProvider.value take the existing instance of a bloc/cubit and provide it to further to child widget
            -> 
    *) Named Routing:
        -> Named Route Access provide an Existing Instance of Bloc/cubit to Multiple Screen navigating with Name Routes
        -> It's Recommended to decide on a Navigation Style Before starting Developing the app, since refactoring the code afterward can get pretty difficult to execute.
        -> we will route use this route on 'MaterialApp' widget
    *) Generated Route:
        -> Generated route is Similar to Named Route, thus having the same Advantages
        -> Some of the differences includes Integrating the entire Navigation Feature inside on file and function
        -> This Unclutters the main.dart file making the entire code More visible and easier to maintain and understand
