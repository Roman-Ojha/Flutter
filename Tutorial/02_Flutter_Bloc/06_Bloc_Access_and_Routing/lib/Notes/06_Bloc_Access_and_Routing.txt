*) Bloc Access:
    -> here we will know how we can access bloc instance across various scenario : BlocProvider() vs BlocProvider.value()
    -> previously we had learned about how we can provide single bloc instance to the widget tree of a single page by using 'BlocProvider' there we had provided locally in single screen
    -> what if we want to provide to another screen to multiple screen or even globally

*) Local Access:
    -> it's called local access because the instance will only be available locally inside that screen

*) Route Access:
    -> providing an instance of a bloc/cubit to Multiple Screens is called as Route Access
    -> To understand Route Access we need to understand Flutter Routing
        => Flutter Routing Options:
            -> Anonymous Routing
                -> Routing without a RouteName
                -> Only the screen are used to navigate
                -> Suitable for Small Application
            -> Named Routing
                -> Navigating With a Routing Name
                -> Route Names and there associated Screens are setup insides parameter of MaterialApp widget
                -> Suitable for Small-Medium Application
            -> Generated Routing
                -> Navigating With A Route Name
                -> Route name and their associated Screens are setup up inside a separate onGenerateRoute Function
                -> Suitable for Large Application
