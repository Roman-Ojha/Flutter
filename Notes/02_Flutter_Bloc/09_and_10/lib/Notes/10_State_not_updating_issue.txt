*) State of a bloc/cubit won't update but...
    *) Why & When is this happening?
        -> When we are emitting the same state as the previous one
        -> Bloc library won't allow two identical state to be emitted one after another
        -> 
    *) How does Dart compare 2 objects?
        -> Two object are equal if and only if both are the same object
        -> so both object that is an instance if same class and have same value as well but are different instance then they are not equal in dart
        -> so to make them equal we can use 'equatable' package or we can override the default behavior of '==' operator
        -> flutter pub add equatable
        -> example: https://github.com/TheWCKD/blocFromZeroToHero/tree/master/%2310%20-%20State%20not%20updating
