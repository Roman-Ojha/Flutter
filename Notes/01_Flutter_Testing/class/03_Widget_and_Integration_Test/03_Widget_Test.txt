=> In Widget and Integration test what we are going to test is actual interface

*) Widget VS Integration:
    -> The basic different between widget and integration test is that widget test, test only single widget
    -> Integration test will test the multiple components and multiple widgets together
    -> another different is Widget test will run in a simulated interface we don't see it but in integration test we can see with emulator what is happening
    -> and using integration test we can test the performance of app as well

*) Widget Test Setup:
    -> Now we are going to create file under the test folder called 'news_page_test.dart'

*) Integration Test Setup:
    -> Now  we will going to create another folder for integration test called 'integration-test' and create file 'app_test.dart'
